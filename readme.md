# Sangmanch: Overview

## User Authentication:

Identification of the program officers & other staff members involved in the working of different activities and events under various programs using Unique Government Issued Identities

### User Roles:

1. General Assembly Member [Highest access control]
2. Governing Body Member [High-Moderate access, need validation from GAM for changes]
3. Finance Committee [Limited Access, Review financial anomaly and forward data to board for approval]
4. ICCR Centre Member [For Centre managers in 37 ICCRs, Can monitor the events planned and attach expenses and budget for future events and track real-time monitoring of pending bids]

## Data Collection:

The data collection will be in the form of web forms. It will be provided only to the ICCR Centre Member to fill in the details of the event, expenses, images of the event, and the invoice in the form of pictures and manual filling in the form by the member. 

## Financial Anomaly Detection::

The detail filled by the user will be verified by three level of checks, which involves: 

1. **Logical Checks:** checks for any mathematical anomaly or inflated bills (unrealistic).
2. **AI Anomaly Detection:** any sudden change in the pattern of events will be flagged by the AI model employed to check for financial anomalies. The Financial Committee will validate this before being raised to the Governing body for their intervention. 
3. **Manual Checks:** Due to the scarcity of niche data for financial anomalies in government events, we will need human intervention to label the data and generate a human-in-the-loop AI pipeline with training on the go. This will be coupled with the AI Anomaly model to transition from a fully supervised to semi-supervised and eventually to a fully automated and unsupervised pipeline. 

## Data Verification:

The Financial Committee will have the invoices from different users lined up in the portal. The approved invoices will be forwarded to the governing body for final approval and funds release. The General Assembly Members have access to every invoice sent by the users, the approval status of governing body, and the status approval from the finance committee. 

## Data Visualization

Infographics provide a better way of generating insights from the data. Compared to tabular data with a continuous inflow from more than 37 countries and 1000+ events, where generating insights from raw data might be a strenuous exercise. Through a graphical dashboard, we intend to serve the stakeholders a visual story of the data collected from various centers and help them strategize and analyze events, expenses, and footfall to strengthen cultural diplomacy.
